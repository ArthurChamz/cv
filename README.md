Hi.

This is the code for my professional CV.

It's based on [Xavier Danaux](ctan.org/author/danaux) excellemt [moderncv](ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) template, as seen in ShareLatex[sharelatex.com].

I've made some addition's of my own, cleaned up the code of things that I'd never use.

I've also filled it up with my own professional information, which you're welcome to see and share around.

This work is licensed under the LPPL 1.3c license. Yup, no more naming disputes.

Thanks for looking, and sharing ;)

Arturo Castro.
